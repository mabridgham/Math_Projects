# Math_Projects

Like the Cryptography project, eventually hope to combine many small programs into one larger command line program 
mostly for fun but also may be helpful with mathematical calculations when needed.

Collection of open source Math python projects that I am currently working on. All source code programs were
obtained and modified from the source below, as well as any .txt files that are included. Also, some of the 
programs require the use of a secondary program called pyperclip.py in order to run but it is not mine and not 
one that I am working on. It was obtained from the source below, specifically from big-book-small-python-programming. 
I will be uploading it for convenience for now until I can figure out how to integrate it into the programs I have 
so they no longer need it separately.
