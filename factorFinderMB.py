print('''Factors are the numbers you multiply together to get another number.
Example: 2 and 3 are factors of 6, because 2 Ã— 3 = 6. Factors are whole numbers,
not fractions.

If a number only has two factors (1 and itself), it is called a prime
number. Otherwise, it is called a composite number.

See if you can spot some prime numbers...
